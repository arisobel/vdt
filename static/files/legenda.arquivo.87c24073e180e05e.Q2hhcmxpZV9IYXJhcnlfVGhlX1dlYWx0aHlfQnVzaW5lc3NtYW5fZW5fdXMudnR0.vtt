00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:01.130
You know, there's a story that I heard

2
00:00:01.130 --> 00:00:02.550
a long time ago that I never really

3
00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:02.910
forgot.

4
00:00:03.730 --> 00:00:05.430
The story about a father and three children.

5
00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:09.170
This father was a prominent man, wealthy businessman,

6
00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:13.010
community leader, and his youngest son was getting

7
00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:13.370
married.

8
00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:14.930
And he decided this was going to be

9
00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:17.470
sort of the cornerstone of his legacy.

10
00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:19.170
He was going to make a wedding that

11
00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:20.030
was going to blow the video away.

12
00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:22.230
And he would invite the community and all

13
00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:25.310
of his clients and colleagues and really bask,

14
00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:27.710
if you will, in his wealth and his

15
00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:28.070
honor.

16
00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:32.310
So he calls up his other boys, his

17
00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:36.250
oldest son, a prominent son to himself, a

18
00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:38.510
businessman, his family of prominence.

19
00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:41.310
Everybody knows him in the community, well dressed.

20
00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:45.090
And he said, listen, the wedding is coming

21
00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:45.290
up.

22
00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:46.570
I want you to come, of course.

23
00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:48.810
And I want you to buy whatever it

24
00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:51.710
is that you need, because this wedding, in

25
00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:54.010
many ways I'm seeing as a manifestation of

26
00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:56.770
my honor, whatever you buy for me, it's

27
00:00:56.770 --> 00:00:57.170
on the house.

28
00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:59.310
So dress yourself, dress your family.

29
00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:00.990
I want you to come looking amazing.

30
00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:02.490
You're my representative.

31
00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:03.849
He says, absolutely.

32
00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:06.110
He calls up his second brother, and now

33
00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:07.510
the second brother wasn't like the first.

34
00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:10.910
The second brother was actually someone who has

35
00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:12.030
struggled his whole life.

36
00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:13.550
Never really found this place.

37
00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:16.630
Never really had any real success.

38
00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.530
And unlike his older brother, how he looked,

39
00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:22.450
what he did, how he dressed, him and

40
00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:24.270
his wife and his kids were almost the

41
00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:24.590
opposite.

42
00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:26.970
And he gives them the same offer.

43
00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:31.250
Day of the wedding comes, and the children

44
00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:32.490
pull up in front of the wedding hall.

45
00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:35.910
The first son gets out and looks, forget

46
00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:40.330
about it, picture perfect, tailored suits, material for

47
00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:42.110
the dresses that come from places that no

48
00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:42.830
one even ever heard of.

49
00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:46.130
The hair, the makeup, everybody matched perfectly.

50
00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:48.850
The family comes out, the oldest family, and

51
00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:50.170
they look amazing.

52
00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:51.790
Everybody's hedged to her.

53
00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:54.230
And the second part pulls up.

54
00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:55.610
I say, I'm her brother.

55
00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:57.890
I have the middle brother.

56
00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:01.110
And the middle brother comes out looking almost

57
00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:01.870
the opposite.

58
00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:05.450
Tattered clothing, suits that didn't match.

59
00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:07.729
No one's hair was done.

60
00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:09.889
Not even really clean.

61
00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:13.110
Clothing that looked old.

62
00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:16.510
And much like in the contrast, they came

63
00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:18.210
out very, very differently than the first brother.

64
00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:20.210
So the wedding goes on, the wedding's wonderful.

65
00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:23.030
Day after the wedding, the oldest son calls

66
00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:24.210
his dad and goes, dad, where do I

67
00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:24.610
send the bills?

68
00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:25.570
He goes, what do you mean?

69
00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:26.790
He goes, no, you told me, whatever I

70
00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:27.730
buy in your honor, you're covered.

71
00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:30.110
So like, way rather than quite a bill.

72
00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:33.630
So Secretary just sends your finance department, like

73
00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:34.710
I just want to know where it goes

74
00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:36.390
because I can use the reimbursement check.

75
00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:38.290
And the father says to the son, I'm

76
00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:38.790
not paying for it.

77
00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:39.870
He goes, what do you mean?

78
00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:40.530
He told me.

79
00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:43.910
Father goes, I told you that I'm going

80
00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:45.550
to pay for that which you buy for

81
00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:45.950
my honor.

82
00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:47.210
He goes, I know.

83
00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:49.190
He goes, you didn't buy your clothes for

84
00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:49.650
my honor.

85
00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:51.490
You bought it for your honor.

86
00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:52.930
He goes, no, I didn't.

87
00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:53.410
And he goes, really?

88
00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:55.450
He goes, don't you know your brother?

89
00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:57.330
Have you not known him your whole life?

90
00:02:58.170 --> 00:02:59.250
Don't you know he would have showed up

91
00:02:59.250 --> 00:02:59.550
that way?

92
00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:01.790
Don't you know that he would have came

93
00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:02.130
to where he looked?

94
00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:04.350
Doesn't your wife know that her sister-in

95
00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:05.350
-law would have looked that way and the

96
00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:05.610
kids?

97
00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:08.370
If you really were worried about my honor,

98
00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:10.130
what you would have done was realize that

99
00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:12.070
I'm paying for it and taking your brother

100
00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:12.490
shopping.

101
00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:14.870
You would have looked around and goes, my

102
00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:17.410
dad is going to see his middle child

103
00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:18.490
looking the way he looks.

104
00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:19.970
I've got to take care of my dad.

105
00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:20.850
It's for his honor.

106
00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:21.790
This is his moment.

107
00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:23.630
You would have went out and spent money

108
00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:24.590
not only on your own stuff.

109
00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:26.770
You would actually spend money on their stuff.

110
00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:28.810
That would have been for my honor.

111
00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:30.310
You didn't do it for my honor.

112
00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:31.610
You did it for your honor.

113
00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:33.110
I'm not paying for your honor.

114
00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:35.710
You know, I heard that story years ago.

115
00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:38.850
And when I heard the story, it clarified

116
00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:41.490
for me something in my mind I never

117
00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:41.950
understood.

118
00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:46.430
Because I'll teach us that when you daven

119
00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:48.970
for somebody else, your telos are answered first.

120
00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:50.090
Why would that be?

121
00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:52.150
You have a personal issue with Hashem.

122
00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:53.810
You know the extent of your suffering.

123
00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:56.150
It should be that only you can daven

124
00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:56.670
for yourself.

125
00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:59.150
Only you can really represent the depths of

126
00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:00.170
the feelings that you have.

127
00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:02.350
You should daven for other people, but why

128
00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:04.450
is there like a gimmick that you daven

129
00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:06.290
for somebody else, you daven for you first?

130
00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:07.350
What does that mean?

131
00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:07.790
How is that?

132
00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:08.830
Why would that work?

133
00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:12.710
But through the story, I understood the answer.

134
00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:16.170
The end of the day, why we're in

135
00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:18.070
this world is for the honor of the

136
00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:18.209
king.

137
00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:20.510
We are here for him.

138
00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:23.670
From the second we left Egypt, all the

139
00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:26.430
way to this moment, the number one focus,

140
00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:30.610
our number one mission is honor to the

141
00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:30.830
king.

142
00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:32.990
That's why we are who we are.

143
00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:36.790
Maybe the reason why we have challenges is

144
00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:40.610
because in life it's hard to understand people.

145
00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:44.590
It's hard to understand what people are struggling

146
00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:44.870
with.

147
00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:48.230
And maybe Hashem is giving us challenges because

148
00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:50.070
it allows us to be sensitive to other

149
00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:50.450
people.

150
00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:53.870
It allows us to see the world and

151
00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:57.190
understand people's needs in a much more tangible

152
00:04:57.190 --> 00:04:57.590
way.

153
00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:01.210
But at the end of the day, do

154
00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:05.690
we care about our honor or his honor?

155
00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:10.810
If we care about our honor, then every

156
00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:12.130
time we feel pain, we just want to

157
00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:12.630
get it solved.

158
00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:15.910
We just want to be better.

159
00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:20.150
If we care about his honor, then we

160
00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:21.170
don't want anyone to have pain.

161
00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:23.990
Why would Hashem want any of his children

162
00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:24.430
to suffer?

163
00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:27.710
Why would Hashem have honor if some of

164
00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:30.450
his kids are not doing as well as

165
00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:30.790
others?

166
00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:32.370
If some of his kids are struggling with

167
00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:39.590
something, any single pain or deficiency in this

168
00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:41.190
world takes away from the honor of the

169
00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:41.390
king.

170
00:05:42.910 --> 00:05:44.050
And so when Hashem sends us a pain,

171
00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:46.690
when he sends us a challenge, if we

172
00:05:46.690 --> 00:05:47.950
cared about his honor, you know what we

173
00:05:47.950 --> 00:05:48.350
would do?

174
00:05:49.090 --> 00:05:51.290
It's around the question, just help them.

175
00:05:52.530 --> 00:05:53.770
I realize it now.

176
00:05:54.630 --> 00:05:55.570
And of course I want to be part

177
00:05:55.570 --> 00:05:57.550
of this, but please help this person and

178
00:05:57.550 --> 00:05:59.090
that person and this person and that person.

179
00:05:59.510 --> 00:06:04.050
Because if you help others, then you, your

180
00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:04.890
honor will be manifest.

181
00:06:05.950 --> 00:06:06.850
I want you to win.

182
00:06:07.870 --> 00:06:09.130
And you're the dad.

183
00:06:10.350 --> 00:06:11.590
And you don't win when one child wins.

184
00:06:11.910 --> 00:06:13.430
You win when all the children win.

185
00:06:15.290 --> 00:06:16.790
Maybe the secret of why we pray for

186
00:06:16.790 --> 00:06:19.310
other people is because we realize that the

187
00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:21.210
reason why I have challenge may be so

188
00:06:21.210 --> 00:06:23.630
that I'm sensitive enough to pray for somebody

189
00:06:23.630 --> 00:06:23.910
else.

190
00:06:25.150 --> 00:06:27.070
Now when I worry about my brother or

191
00:06:27.070 --> 00:06:29.850
my sister, Hashem says, you really care about

192
00:06:29.850 --> 00:06:30.190
me.

193
00:06:30.770 --> 00:06:31.890
You really care about me?

194
00:06:32.150 --> 00:06:34.070
Well, then if you care about me, then

195
00:06:34.070 --> 00:06:36.650
maybe the block doesn't need to be there

196
00:06:36.650 --> 00:06:37.030
anymore.

197
00:06:39.930 --> 00:06:41.290
My brach is that all of us, no

198
00:06:41.290 --> 00:06:44.010
matter what challenges that we face, is that

199
00:06:44.010 --> 00:06:46.890
we use the challenge to be able to

200
00:06:46.890 --> 00:06:50.790
see the needs of others and that we're

201
00:06:50.790 --> 00:06:53.410
sensitive enough to realize that the greatest thing

202
00:06:53.410 --> 00:06:56.170
that I could do in this world is

203
00:06:56.170 --> 00:06:57.250
give honor to the king.

204
00:06:58.550 --> 00:07:00.710
And when I hope and when I pray

205
00:07:00.710 --> 00:07:02.430
and when I spend, if you owe my

206
00:07:02.430 --> 00:07:05.530
money, if you owe my prayers to dress

207
00:07:05.530 --> 00:07:07.130
up and to better the lives of everybody

208
00:07:07.130 --> 00:07:09.730
else, I am showing him that it's his

209
00:07:09.730 --> 00:07:11.130
art that I care about first.

210
00:07:12.110 --> 00:07:13.490
And with that, maybe Hashem works out and

211
00:07:13.490 --> 00:07:15.290
goes, it's about time you got it.

212
00:07:15.950 --> 00:07:18.170
And if you care about that, well then,

213
00:07:18.270 --> 00:07:20.190
I'm going to make sure that you get

214
00:07:20.190 --> 00:07:20.710
answered first.
