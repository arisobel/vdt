00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:01,900
(Transcrito por TurboScribe.ai. Atualize para Ilimitado para remover esta mensagem.) I'll leave you off with a beautiful story

2
00:00:03,019 --> 00:00:06,120
that happened to one of the great rabbis

3
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:09,980
of our generation, Agaon Rav Shteynman, Zecher et

4
00:00:09,980 --> 00:00:11,220
Tzaddik V'Kadosh L'Bedacham.

5
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:12,780
I'm sure many of you have heard about

6
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:14,080
the great Tzaddik, if not even all of

7
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:14,180
you.

8
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:16,740
I was in Israel when he passed away.

9
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:18,700
It was right before Hanukkah.

10
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:27,000
Such an unbelievable Tzaddik.

11
00:00:27,980 --> 00:00:30,100
The power, his warmth.

12
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:33,040
I'm sure many of you might have even

13
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:35,160
been Zocher to be by the rabbi.

14
00:00:36,260 --> 00:00:38,080
And something amazing happened, that one time the

15
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:39,000
rabbi was in America.

16
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:43,740
In one of his unbelievable holy avodot that

17
00:00:43,740 --> 00:00:44,160
he was doing.

18
00:00:45,340 --> 00:00:47,140
And unfortunately he wasn't feeling well.

19
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:50,220
So they had to fly him back to

20
00:00:50,220 --> 00:00:50,500
Israel.

21
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:54,380
They're not putting the rabbi on no Boeing

22
00:00:54,380 --> 00:00:57,140
747, not even first class.

23
00:00:57,420 --> 00:00:59,940
They chartered the rabbi a private jet.

24
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:05,000
He got a philanthropist from Canada and he

25
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,220
flew the rabbi back on a private jet.

26
00:01:08,140 --> 00:01:10,560
So the rabbi is going on the private

27
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:10,860
jet.

28
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:14,960
And the jet could hold up to 10

29
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:15,260
people.

30
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:17,640
Being that the rabbi is from Bnei Brak,

31
00:01:17,940 --> 00:01:18,500
they fit 20.

32
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:20,400
So the rabbi is going on the plane.

33
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:21,660
He's sitting over there.

34
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:23,080
Tzaddikim, they're not going with the rabbi.

35
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:23,900
They're not leaving the rabbi.

36
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:25,400
So he's on the plane.

37
00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:27,160
And the plane takes off.

38
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:30,280
And the head steward comes over to the

39
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:31,420
rabbi in the middle of the flight.

40
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:34,200
And he says, I understand that the rabbi

41
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:37,260
is the VIP of the flight.

42
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
All of this is just for you.

43
00:01:40,540 --> 00:01:42,380
So I'm going to be your head steward

44
00:01:42,380 --> 00:01:42,900
for the flight.

45
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:46,300
Anything you need, we can get you on

46
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:46,660
this plane.

47
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:50,540
But anything, we can get you on this

48
00:01:50,540 --> 00:01:50,840
flight.

49
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:55,300
Kalim 25, Shaburma, anything that you might need,

50
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:57,220
anything, you can probably get on the flight.

51
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:59,040
Is there anything that we can get you?

52
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:01,660
So he starts thinking.

53
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:04,080
And the Hasidim are confused.

54
00:02:05,540 --> 00:02:06,420
Rabbi, you're thinking?

55
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:09,840
At home, you barely eat a small piece

56
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:10,660
of bread and a little butter.

57
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:13,640
On the plane with this goyim, you're thinking

58
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:14,940
what you need on the flight.

59
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:15,820
They're confused.

60
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:17,740
So he says, give me 10 minutes, let

61
00:02:17,740 --> 00:02:18,360
me think of something.

62
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:19,320
Okay?

63
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:22,180
10 minutes later, the steward comes back to

64
00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:23,900
the rabbi, and he says, Rabbi, what can

65
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:24,360
we get you?

66
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:26,360
So the rabbi says, you said you can

67
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:27,040
do anything, right?

68
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:28,800
Anything you need, Rabbi, please tell us, we'll

69
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:29,360
have you on the plane.

70
00:02:29,740 --> 00:02:30,520
Anything I need?

71
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:30,860
Anything.

72
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:33,520
He says, well, you see, we pray three

73
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:34,060
times a day.

74
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:35,280
Jews.

75
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:39,000
The morning prayer, afternoon, and evening prayer.

76
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:41,580
One, I was able to make before the

77
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:41,800
flight.

78
00:02:42,460 --> 00:02:43,940
The third, I'll be able to pray in

79
00:02:43,940 --> 00:02:44,160
Israel.

80
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:46,400
But the second, I'm going to have to

81
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,120
pray on the plane.

82
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:49,680
I don't like praying on the plane, my

83
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:50,260
concentration.

84
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:51,980
Could you please land the plane?

85
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:56,920
Are you kidding?

86
00:02:57,300 --> 00:02:57,520
Where?

87
00:02:57,700 --> 00:02:58,220
In the middle of nowhere?

88
00:02:58,500 --> 00:02:59,260
Land the plane?

89
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:00,740
What do you want?

90
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:03,080
He said he was doing it.

91
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:03,580
I'm just asking.

92
00:03:04,340 --> 00:03:05,400
Okay, he goes to the cockpit.

93
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:07,440
A few minutes later, the captain gets on

94
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:07,780
the MC.

95
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:09,640
Gentlemen, please take your seat.

96
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:10,520
We're getting ready for landing.

97
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:11,600
In the middle of nowhere.

98
00:03:12,020 --> 00:03:12,740
I don't know where they landed.

99
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:13,860
He landed the plane.

100
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:15,400
Rabbi got off with his minyan.

101
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:16,700
He prays.

102
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:17,900
He gets back on the plane.

103
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:18,680
And he takes off.

104
00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:20,580
Unbelievable.

105
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:21,880
Rabbi, come on.

106
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:22,500
What are you doing?

107
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:25,560
Do you understand what tefillah is?

108
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:28,040
Why would I miss one?

109
00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:30,180
We could pray on the plane.

110
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:31,600
But it won't be the same.

111
00:03:32,380 --> 00:03:33,420
Every tefillah is priceless.

112
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:35,280
And Burei Olam loves us.

113
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:37,280
He's given us the opportunity to pray whenever

114
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:37,720
we like.

115
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:39,220
24-7, 365.

116
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:41,760
He gives us his undivided attention.

117
00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:44,100
All we have to do is tap into

118
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:47,800
this unbelievable and beautiful kovach called tefillah.

119
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,360
To work more on my tefillah.

120
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:55,240
Amen, amen.

121
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:56,100
Everybody, thank you for coming.

122
00:03:56,580 --> 00:03:58,360
And have a wonderful Rosh Chodes Tov.
